# Spreadsheet Application<br>
<p>This is a spreadsheet application I created as a final project for a class at WSU: CptS 321 Software Engineering Principles I.</p>
<p>The application was made to be similar to apps like Microsoft Excel with only basic functionality. I followed a test driven development (TDD) process where I wrote my unit tests and skeletal code before writing any actual implementation. I also followed a Agile Scrum framework, implementing only a few features at a time. I initally created this project in a now deleted private repository and migrated the project files to this repository afterwards, resulting in losing all of my commit history.</p>
<p>This project is my best example of following a TDD process and strict documentation guidelines. I believe it also showcases my ability to analyze and utilize existing documentation, as my primary resource for this project was the official Microsoft C# documentation. I worked entirely independently, so this is not a good example of my abilities to work on a team.</p>
