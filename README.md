# Spreadsheet Application<br>
This is a spreadsheet application I created as a final project for CptS 321 Object-Oriented Software Principles at WSU.

The application was made to be similar to apps like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, with only basic functionality. I followed a test driven development (TDD) process where I wrote my unit tests and skeletal code before writing any actual implementation. I also followed a Agile Scrum framework, implementing only a few features at a time. I initally created this project in a now deleted private repository and migrated the project files to this repository afterwards, resulting in losing all of my commit history.

This project is my best example of following a TDD process and strict documentation guidelines, as well as working in a fully object-oriented environment and utilizing its existing libraries and framework (.NET). I believe it also showcases my ability to analyze and utilize existing documentation, as my primary resource for this project was the official Microsoft .NET documentation. This project is also another great example of separating the UI and logic engine to maintain high cohesion and low coupling.

I worked entirely independently, so this is not a good example of my abilities to work on a team.
